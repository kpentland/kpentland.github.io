  <p>
    I am a computational scientist working in the plasma simulation group at the <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/" target="_blank">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in all sorts of mathematical modelling problems (regardless of the application) and often find myself working at the interface between applied and computational mathematics. I have particular interests in:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Numerical integration for ODEs/PDEs. </li>
  <li> Surrogate modelling (e.g. Gaussian processes). </li>
  <li> Bayesian methods (e.g. data assimilation, optimisation, UQ). </li>
  <li> Parallel-in-Time (PinT) methods. </li>
  <li> High performance computing. </li>
  <li> Multiscale/hybrid modelling problems. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Do get in contact if you'd like to discuss any of my research or are interested in collaboration!
