  The aim of this project was to reproduce the 3D FEM HPC simulation results of Li et al. (2012) that claimed "no discrete set of oscillatory modes exist in a spin-down fluid within a half-cone geometry" using much simpler techniques.
  To do this, we derived a 2D topographic wave equation for the half-cone geometry and used both spectral methods and eigenmode analysis to recreate the numerical results.
  In fact, we disprove their conclusion that no oscillatory modes exist because of the half-cone's vertex, demonstrating instead that no modes exist only when the depth of the half-cone container goes to zero.
