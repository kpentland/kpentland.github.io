  In this project, we explored improvements to an existing model that predicts the trajectory and deformation of water droplets impacting aircraft surfaces, focusing on the critical effects of high-speed airflows. Using sensitivity analysis and high-resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS), we identified key influencing parameters and improved the accuracy of the model. Our results highlight the potential of DNS for more precise simulation of droplet behavior in complex flow conditions.
