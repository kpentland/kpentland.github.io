abstract: >-
  In this thesis, we focus on developing probabilistic time-parallel algorithms to efficiently solve computationally intensive initial value problems (IVPs).
  We introduce SParareal, a sampling-based algorithm that accelerates convergence by drawing candidate solution values from probability distributions derived from fine and coarse solution data, and GParareal, a learning-based algorithm that employs a Gaussian process emulator to enhance the predictor-corrector scheme. 
  Both algorithms demonstrate improved numerical speedup and accuracy while providing stochastic solutions that quantify uncertainty, with GParareal uniquely leveraging legacy solution data from previous simulations.
