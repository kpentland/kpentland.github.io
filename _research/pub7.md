  In this project, we developed the Neural-Parareal framework to enhance the efficiency of time-parallel simulations for fusion research by integrating neural operators that dynamically train as new data becomes available. 
  This approach replaces traditional coarse-solvers with neural network surrogates, leading to progressively more accurate predictions and significant speed-ups in the parareal simulations. 
  Our findings demonstrate the effective convergence of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, advocating for their common use in digital engineering design.
